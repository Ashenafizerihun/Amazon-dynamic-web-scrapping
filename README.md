This project involves building a web scraping tool using Selenium to extract data from Amazon's dynamically loading book pages. 
The scraper retrieves key details about books, including the title, author, publication date, and prices for Kindle, paperback, 
and hardcover editions. It also records the extraction date for tracking purposes. The project addresses challenges related to 
dynamically rendered content by leveraging Selenium's automation capabilities to interact with and extract data from the website:
